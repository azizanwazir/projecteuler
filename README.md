## Welcome to my Project Euler Journey!

My goal is to improve my skill as a programmer for both my work and personal improvement. As such, I'll be trying to find solutions that are as generic, flexible and efficient as possible to gain the most out of these challenges.

The 'drafts' folder will contain empty or unsolved scripts and the 'final' folder will contain my solved scripts (without spoilers for answers). I may create test scripts at a later date that will check if the answers are correct.

I have also included a script in 'misc_scripts' that will create empty Python scripts using data from 'project_euler.xlsx' so as to standardise the scripts I add to this repository.

Thanks for checking in and hope something here has been helpful for you!

_Note: Sharing solutions beyond the first 100 problems outside the Project Euler website is not allowed, therefore any solutions I have to problems beyond Problem #100 will not be posted here._
